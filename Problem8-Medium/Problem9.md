# Problem Explanation

## Reading Input:

The code reads input from the standard input using a stdin_iterator.
It reads the first line of input, splits it by whitespace, parses the values as i32, and collects them into a vector first_multiple_input.
It extracts the values of n (the size of the chessboard) and k (the number of obstacles) from first_multiple_input.

## Reading Queen's Position:

It reads the second line of input, splits it by whitespace, parses the values as i32, and collects them into a vector second_multiple_input.
It extracts the row (r_q) and column (c_q) of the queen's position from second_multiple_input.

## Reading Obstacles:

It initializes an empty vector obstacles to store the positions of the obstacles.
It iterates k times to read the positions of the obstacles.
For each obstacle, it reads a line of input, splits it by whitespace, parses the values as i32, and collects them into a vector obstacle.
It pushes each obstacle vector into the obstacles vector.

## Function queensAttack:

This function is not fully visible in the provided code, but it calculates the number of squares the queen can attack on an n x n chessboard, given the queen's position and the positions of the obstacles.
It takes the size of the chessboard n, the number of obstacles k, the queen's row r_q, the queen's column c_q, and a reference to the obstacles vector as parameters.
It returns the number of squares the queen can attack.

## Printing the Result:

The code calls the queensAttack function with the appropriate parameters and stores the result in the result variable.
It prints the result to the standard output.
