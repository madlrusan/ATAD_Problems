# Problem Explanation

## Imports:

The code imports necessary modules from the standard library: env, fs::File, and io for handling environment variables, file operations, and input/output operations respectively.

## Function formingMagicSquare:

This function is not fully visible in the provided code, but it appears to calculate the minimum cost to convert a given 3x3 matrix into a magic square.
A magic square is a 3x3 grid where the sums of the numbers in each row, column, and diagonal are equal.
The visible part of the function uses iterators and functional programming techniques to calculate the cost of converting the input matrix into a magic square.

## Function main:

This is the entry point of the program.
It reads input from the standard input and writes output to a file specified by the OUTPUT_PATH environment variable.
It initializes a stdin_iterator to read lines from the standard input.
It creates a file to write the output using the OUTPUT_PATH environment variable.
It initializes a 2D vector s to store the 3x3 matrix.
It reads 3 lines of input, splits each line by spaces, parses the values as integers, and stores them in the matrix s.
It calls the formingMagicSquare function with the matrix s and writes the result to the output file.
