# Explained solution: 
This Rust program reads two integers from the standard input, computes their sum, and prints the result. It begins by importing the std::io module to handle input and output operations. Within the main function, two mutable string variables, _num_str_1 and _num_str_2, are declared to store the input values. The program then reads a line of input for each variable using the read_line method, ensuring that any read errors are handled with an appropriate message. The input strings are trimmed of any whitespace and parsed into integers of type i32, with error handling to catch any parsing issues. Finally, the program computes the sum of the two integers and prints the result using the println! macro. This simple program demonstrates basic input handling, error checking, and arithmetic operations in Rust.
