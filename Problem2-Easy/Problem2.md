# Problem Explanation

## Imports:

The code imports necessary modules from the standard library: env, fs::File, and io for handling environment variables, file operations, and input/output operations respectively.

## Function diagonalDifference:

This function calculates the absolute difference between the sums of the primary and secondary diagonals of a square matrix.
It takes a reference to a 2D vector of integers `(&[Vec<i32>])` as a parameter.
It initializes two sums: primary_diagonal_sum and secondary_diagonal_sum.
It iterates over the matrix to calculate the sums of the primary diagonal (top-left to bottom-right) and the secondary diagonal (top-right to bottom-left).
Finally, it returns the absolute difference between the two sums.

## Function main:

This is the entry point of the program.
It reads input from the standard input and writes output to a file specified by the OUTPUT_PATH environment variable.
It initializes a stdin_iterator to read lines from the standard input.
It creates a file to write the output using the OUTPUT_PATH environment variable.
It reads the size of the matrix n from the input.
It initializes a 2D vector arr to store the matrix.
It reads n lines of input, splits each line by spaces, parses the values as integers, and stores them in the matrix arr.
It calls the diagonalDifference function with the matrix arr and writes the result to the output file.
