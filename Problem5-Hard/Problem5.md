## Function println!:

This line prints each row of the matrix after performing some operations (not fully visible in the provided code).
It converts each element of the row to a string, collects them into a vector, and joins them with a space separator.

## Function main:

This is the entry point of the program.
It reads input from the standard input.
It initializes a stdin_iterator to read lines from the standard input.
It reads the first line of input and splits it into three parts, parsing them as usize values and storing them in a vector first_multiple_input.
It extracts the values of m, n, and r from first_multiple_input. m and n represent the dimensions of the matrix, and r represents the number of rotations.
It initializes a 2D vector matrix with dimensions m x n, filled with zeros.
It reads the next m lines of input, splits each line by spaces, parses the values as i32, and stores them in the corresponding row of the matrix.
It calls the matrixRotation function with the matrix and the number of rotations r.

## Function matrixRotation:

This function is not fully visible in the provided code, but it is responsible for rotating the matrix r times.
The rotation logic is not shown, but it typically involves shifting the elements of the matrix in a specific pattern.
