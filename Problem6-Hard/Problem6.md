# Problem Explanation

## Function ashtonString:

This function is not fully visible in the provided code, but it appears to find the k-th character in a concatenated string of sorted substrings.
It converts the substrings into a sorted vector sorted_substrings.
It initializes current_length to keep track of the length of the concatenated substrings processed so far.
It iterates over each substring in sorted_substrings.
For each substring, it checks if the k-th character is within the current substring by comparing current_length + substring_length with k.
If the k-th character is within the current substring, it returns the character at the appropriate position.
If not, it updates current_length by adding the length of the current substring.
The function uses unreachable!() to indicate that k is guaranteed to be valid as per problem constraints.

## Function main:

This is the entry point of the program.
It reads input from the standard input and writes output to a file specified by the OUTPUT_PATH environment variable.
It initializes a stdin_iterator to read lines from the standard input.
It creates a file to write the output using the OUTPUT_PATH environment variable.
It reads the number of test cases t from the input.
For each test case, it reads the string s and the integer k from the input.
It calls the ashtonString function with the string s and the integer k, and writes the result to the output file.
